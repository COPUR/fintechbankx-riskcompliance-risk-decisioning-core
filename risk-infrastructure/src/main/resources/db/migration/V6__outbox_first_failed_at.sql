-- Retryable send failures (broker, DNS or mesh-egress outages) no longer count
-- toward parking; V4's max-attempts cap is removed. A row is parked on a
-- retryable failure only after it has been failing continuously for longer
-- than risk.outbox.relay.retryable-park-after (default 24 h), measured from
-- first_failed_at. Non-retriable failures still park at once.
