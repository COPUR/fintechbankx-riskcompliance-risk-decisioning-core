## Repository

- Name: fintechbankx-riskcompliance-risk-decisioning-core
- Last Updated: 2026-03-24

## Completed

1. Baseline cell architecture plan document added.
2. Backlog board initialized for execution tracking.

## In Progress

1. Define service-level cell boundary and dependency matrix.
2. Confirm strict mTLS and deny-by-default policy coverage.
3. Confirm resilience policy posture (timeouts/retries/circuit breakers).

## Next

1. Execute at least one controlled degradation drill.
2. Capture evidence artifacts under docs/operations/evidence/.
3. Wire required CI checks for cell controls and contract conformance.
4. Publish closure note and readiness status.

## Risks

1. Hidden synchronous cross-cell dependencies.
2. Incomplete observability tags for drill evidence.
3. Policy drift across environments.
