# Cell-Based Architecture Implementation Plan

## Repository

- Name: fintechbankx-riskcompliance-risk-decisioning-core
- Generated: 2026-03-24

## Objective

Align this repository with the FinTechBankX cell-based architecture model to reduce blast radius, enforce strong isolation boundaries, and improve operational resilience.

## Scope

In scope:
1. Cell-aware runtime policy references
2. Isolation and dependency boundary checks
3. Drill-readiness and evidence integration
4. Backlog alignment with enterprise cell roadmap

Out of scope:
1. Cross-domain functional redesign
2. Multi-region active-active rollout

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Boundary Definition
1. Define cell ownership boundary for this service/capability.
2. Document synchronous vs asynchronous dependency policy.
3. Mark critical dependencies and fallback behavior.

### Phase 2: Runtime Hardening
1. Enforce strict mTLS in service mesh paths.
2. Apply deny-by-default authorization and network policies.
3. Enforce timeout/retry/circuit breaker controls for critical dependencies.

### Phase 3: Validation and Evidence
1. Execute resilience drills aligned with service criticality.
2. Capture evidence artifacts with timestamps and metrics.
3. Validate API/event contracts under degraded conditions.

### Phase 4: Rollout and Governance
1. Gate release on policy and contract validation checks.
2. Track completion in backlog board.
3. Publish closure status with operational sign-off.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Boundary rules are documented and approved.
2. Security and resilience controls are verifiable in CI/CD.
3. Drill evidence exists for required failure scenarios.
4. Backlog status is synchronized with enterprise roadmap.
